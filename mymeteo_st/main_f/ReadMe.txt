there's memory's leaking without destructors into Symbol_Part inharitancing classes
Symbol::Get_Private_Part is working, but returns only first member of pair Changeable_Array
!!!Now we can begin to test cout of figure_kit_ - before this all have been compiled successfully, shared_ptr is ready OK
The shared pointer is working, but it is wrong with math - coords is wrong OK

------------------------------------
New era - creating of new Changeable_array by linked list in change_arr_.h
