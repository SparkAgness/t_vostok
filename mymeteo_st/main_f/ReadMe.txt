there's memory's leaking without destructors into Symbol_Part inharitancing classes
Symbol::Get_Private_Part is working, but returns only first member of pair Changeable_Array
!!!Now we can begin to test cout of figure_kit_ - before this all have been compiled successfully, shared_ptr is ready OK
The shared pointer is working, but it is wrong with math - coords is wrong OK
MinMax_Cell is not wrong in Max x, min y - to find deciding ways for searchin minimum... (4th parameter of MinMax_Cell()) it has been debugged
Erase_Corner is debugging - to test Fill_Erase() - coords_ in SymbolPart is empty
